NOTE: NOTE ON VARIATIONS: There is also another board called the http://www.ti.com/tool/CC3200MODLAUNCHXL[CC3200MODLAUNCHXL] which works exactly the same but uses the module version of the CC3200. It is more expensive, so it’s usually better to use the http://www.ti.com/tool/CC3200-LAUNCHXL[CC3200-LAUNCHXL] for evaluation purposes unless you need to test the module version.

This hardware is open source! Get the http://www.ti.com/lit/zip/swrc289[design files] from TI.
