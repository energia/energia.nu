The http://www.ti.com/tool/CC3200-LAUNCHXL[CC3200-LAUNCHXL] has on board Wi-Fi to easily add a wireless connection to the internet. Use the Energia WiFi library to get online quickly and easily.  You can also make use of many community contributed libraries that utilize the WiFi library APIs.

NOTE: NOTE ON VARIATIONS: There is also another board called the http://www.ti.com/tool/CC3200MODLAUNCHXL[CC3200MODLAUNCHXL] which works exactly the same but uses the module version of the CC3200. It is more expensive, so it's usually better to use the http://www.ti.com/tool/CC3200-LAUNCHXL[CC3200-LAUNCHXL] for evaluation purposes unless you need to test the module version.

This hardware is open source! Get the http://www.ti.com/lit/zip/swrc289[design files] from TI.
