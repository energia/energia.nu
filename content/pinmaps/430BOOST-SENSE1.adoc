== Guide to the Capacitive Touch BoosterPack
:icons: font
NOTE: The 430BOOST-SENSE1 has been discontinued and is no longer available for purchase.

Energia supports the Capacitive Touch BoosterPack made by Texas Instruments. The BoosterPack let's you quickly incorporate touch elements into your LaunchPad projects.  This BoosterPack utilizes the capacitive touch I/Os found on certain MSP430 LaunchPads so it won't work on all LaunchPads. Check out the tool folder (http://www.ti.com/tool/430boost-sense1) for more information. You can find the Energia library HERE.
