== Wires ==

Wires help us connect electrical components into circuits. A wire essentially is any length of +
conductive material that can join electrical components. There are many types of wires with +
different gauges, connectors, and internals. For breadboarding, you can use male jumper wires +
to connect the rows together. On a printed circuit board, there are traces, which are essentially +
copper wires connecting components.
