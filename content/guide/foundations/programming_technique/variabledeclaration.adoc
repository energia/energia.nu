== Variables ==

A variable is a way of naming and storing a value for later use by the program, such as data from +
a sensor or an intermediate value used in a calculation.

=== Declaring Variables ===

Before they are used, all variables have to be declared. Declaring a variable means defining its +
type, and optionally, setting an initial value (initializing the variable). Variables do not have to +
be initialized (assigned a value) when they are declared, but it is often useful.

----
int inputVariable1;
int inputVariable2 = 0;     // both are correct
----

Programmers should consider the size of the numbers they wish to store in choosing variable +
types. Variables will roll over when the value stored exceeds the space assigned to store it. See +
below for an example.

=== Variable Scope ===

Another important choice that programmers face is where to declare variables. The specific +
place that variables are declared influences how various functions in a program will _see_ the + 
variable. This is called variable http://energia.nu/reference/scope/[scope].

=== Initializing Variables ===

Variables may be _initialized_ (assigned a starting value) when they are declared or not. It is +
always good programming practice however to double check that a variable has valid data in it, +
before it is accessed for some other purpose.

Example:

----
 int calibrationVal = 17;  // declare calibrationVal and set initial value
----

=== Variable Rollover ===

When variables are made to exceed their maximum capacity they “roll over” back to their +
minimum capacity, note that this happens in both directions.

----
   int x
   x = -32,768;
   x = x - 1;       // x now contains 32,767 - rolls over in neg. direction
 

   x = 32,767;
   x = x + 1;       // x now contains -32,768 - rolls over
---- 

=== Using Variables ===

Once variables have been declared, they are used by setting the variable equal to the value one +
wishes to store with the http://energia.nu/reference/assignment/[assignment operator] (single equal sign). The assignment operator tells +
the program to put whatever is on the right side of the equal sign into the variable on the left +
side.

----
inputVariable1 = 7;             // sets the variable named inputVariable1 to 7
inputVariable2 = analogRead(2); // sets the variable named inputVariable2 to the 
                                // (digitized) input voltage read from analog pin #2
---- 

=== Examples ===

----
 int lightSensVal;
   char currentLetter;
   unsigned long speedOfLight = 186000UL;
   char errorMessage = {"choose another option"}; // see string
----

Once a variable has been set (assigned a value), you can test its value to see if it meets certain +
conditions, or you can use its value directly. For instance, the following code tests whether the +
`inputVariable2` is less than 100, then sets a delay based on `inputVariable2` which is a minimum +
of 100:

----
if (inputVariable2 < 100)
{
  inputVariable2 = 100;
}

delay(inputVariable2);
----

This example shows all three useful operations with variables. It tests the variable ( `if` +
`(inputVariable2 < 100)` ), it sets the variable if it passes the test ( `inputVariable2 = 100` ), +
and it uses the value of the variable as an input parameter to the `delay()` function +
( `delay(inputVariable2)` )
 
*Style Note:* You should give your variables descriptive names, so as to make your code more +
readable. Variable names like *tiltSensor* or *pushButton* help you (and anyone else reading +
your code) understand what the variable represents. Variable names like *var* or *value*, on the +
other hand, do little to make your code readable.

You can name a variable any word that is not already one of the keywords in Energia. Avoid +
beginning variable names with numeral characters.
