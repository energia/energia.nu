== Communication Protocols ==

Serial and Parallel communication is very important in electronics and software. We often need to pass data between parts of a system. SPI, I2C, and UART are some popular communication protocols for electronics.

To use SPI in Energia, use the http://energia.nu/guide/libraries/spi/[SPI library]. To use I2C in Energia, use the link:/guide/libraries/wire/[Wire library]. To use UART in Energia, use the link:/guide/libraries/serial/[Serial library].
