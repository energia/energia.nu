== Integrated Circuits ==

ICs are components that are packaged up in various forms with various features and +
capabilities. They can be through hole or surface mount devices. A processor, like a +
microcontroller, is an IC, and usually a pretty complicated one. A shift register is another +
example of an IC. Each IC has a job that it is suited for in a circuit and usually it helps +
significantly reduce the size of electronics.
