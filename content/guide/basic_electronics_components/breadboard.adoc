A breadboard is a workspace that has electrical connections. Each row is electrically connected +
to each point on the row. To make new connections, you use wires to connect rows to each other. +
There are larger columns on the side that are called power rails. These are for your VCC (power) +
and GND (ground) signals. You can use these to easily connect any rows to VCC or GND.
