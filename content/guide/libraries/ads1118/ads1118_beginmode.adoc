ADS.begin(unsigned int mode)
----------------------------

### Description

Configures the ADS1118 to the mode that is defined in the argument of
the function. "mode" should be passed as either a '0' or a '1'. 'o' will
set the ADS1118 to convert the voltage of the integrated temperature
sensor and '1' will set the ADS1118 is set to convert the voltage of the
thermocouple. The ADS1118 communicates over SPI, so this function also
begins the SPI communication that allows the LaunchPad and ADS1118
BoosterPack to communicate.

### Syntax

-   ADS.begin(0); //sets to mode 0
-   ADS.begin(1); //sets to mode 1

 

### Parameters

mode - an unsigned int that should pass either a '0' or a '1'  

### Returns

None.  

### Example:

    ADS1118 ADS;

    void setup() {
        ADS.begin(0);
    }

    void loop() {}
