ADS.ADCcode2temp(int code)
--------------------------

### Description

This function is used to convert ADC result codes to temperature.
Converted temperature range is 0 to 500 Celsius degrees. Type K
thermocouple is used. ADC input range is +/-256mV. 16bits. so 1 LSB =
7.8125uV. The coefficient of code to temperature is 1 degree = 40/7.8125
LSBs. Because of nonlinearity of thermocouple. Different coefficients
are used in different temperature ranges.

### Syntax
