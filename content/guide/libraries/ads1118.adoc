### Overview

This guide will help you get started with the ADS1118 Thermocouple
BoosterPack using your LaunchPad enabled in Energia. The ADS1118 is a
precision analog-to-digital converter (ADC). It can perform up to 860
samples per second (SPS) and has an onboard programmable gain amplifier
(PGA) that allows input ranges from m +/-256 mV to +/-6.144 V. The ADS1118
Booster Pack showcases a Type K Thermocouple. A thermocouple consists of
two conductors of different materials that produce a voltage in the
vicinity of the point where the two conductors are in contact. Type K is
the most common general purpose thermocouple with a sensitivity of
approximately 41 uV/^0C. A type K thermocouple is inexpensive, and a wide
variety of probes are available in the -200^0C to +1250^0C (-330^0F to
+2460^0F) range. This library exposes this functionality and allows the
user to interact with it and enable the ADS1118 Thermocouple in a
variety of applications. You can visit the following link to buy and
gather more information on the ADS1118
BoosterPack. <http://www.ti.com/tool/430boost-ads1118>.

### Hardware Configuration

In order to get started with our ADS1118 BoosterPack, simply connect the
ADS1118 BoosterPack to the LaunchPad of your choice. Next, connect the
thermocouple to your BoosterPack to the appropriate plug on your
BoosterPack. Once everything is connected and any other BoosterPacks you
want to interact with are stacked appropriately, plug your LaunchPad
into your computer. This should provide power to the LCD screen and the
backlight will light up. Now you are ready to start interacting with the
ADS1118 BoosterPack!

### Software Configuration

To get started with our ADS1118 BoosterPack, first you must open
Energia. The first step is to include the ADS1118 Library.

-   \#include &lt;ADS1118.h&gt;

Then next, we need to instantiate an instance of our ADS1118 Library.
For example type the following before the setup or loop functions in
Energia:

-   ADS1118 ADS;

Once an instance of the ADS1118 Library has been created, you can start
using the functions detailed in the library. Below is an example program
that will read the temperature from the ADS1118 in Fahrenheit and print
it to a Serial port.

### Example:

    #include <ADS1118.h>

    ADS1118 ADS;

    void setup() {
            Serial.begin(9600); // starts serial comm at 9600 baud
        ADS.begin();
            noTone(2);       //ensures no tone coming from ADS BoosterPack
    }

    void loop() {
            //prints temp in farenheit every 100ms
            Serial.println(ADS.readFarenheit());
            delay(100);
    }
