## BLE library


This library enables Energia users to quickly add BLE communication to
their LaunchPad project. The Energia BLE library is designed to
communicate with a CC2650MODA BoosterPack configured as a network
processor. The BLE library is built on the power of Energia MT (TI-RTOS)
and the SAP lib which ensures that both devices are in the lowest power
state at all times. Peripheral and Broadcaster roles are supported by
the library, making it easy to connect your device to a smartphone or
PC. This page will document the Energia BLE library APIs as well as an
in-depth look at the two supported examples. *Note: A common naming
convention among dual MCU wireless designs is to refer to the processor
that runs the user application (i.e. Energia on MSP432) as the
application processor (AP) and the processor that runs the wireless
stack (i.e. TI BLE Stack on CC2650MODA) as the network processor (NP).
We will adopt this convention throughout this documentation.* Supported
Devices: MSP432

### Connecting the boards

The AP and NP must frequently interact to exchange commands and status
information related to the BLE connection and user data transfer. This
interaction is achieved through a four wire interface that is based on
the UART communication. The additional two wires are handshaking lines
that are required to ensure that both devices are awake and ready to
receive messages before starting a transaction. This helps ensure that
your Energia designs are consuming the lowest power possible. Please see
the table below for the pins used in this interface. *Note: The pins
below are required by the BLE Energia Library for proper operation.
These pins may not be used by the user application or otherwise
electrically loaded.*

### Sample Applications

The Energia BLE library ships with two sample applications:

-   [SerialOverBLE](http://energia.nu/reference/ble/serialoverblesampleapp/)
-   [BLEInputOutput](http://energia.nu/reference/ble/bleinputoutputsampleapp/)

  These sample applications demonstrate the capabilities of the BLE
Energia library and should provide a foundation for user development
using the library.

### BLE class

The BLE class initializes the communication layer with the NP and
provides an interface for the Energia sketch to configure it. Basic BLE
functionality is controlled by the following:

* link:../ble/ble-begin[begin()]
* link:../ble/ble-setloglevel[setLogLevel()]
* link:../ble/ble-handleevents[handleEvents()]
* link:../ble/ble-terminateconn[terminateConn()]
* link:../ble/ble-end[end()]
* link:../ble/ble-isconnected[isConnected()]
* link:../ble/ble-isadvertising[isAdvertising()]
* link:../ble/ble-addservice[addService()]
* link:../ble/ble-startadvert[startAdvert()]
* link:../ble/ble-stopadvert[stopAdvert()]
* link:../ble/ble-setadvertname[setAdvertName()]
* link:../ble/ble-writevalue[writeValue()]
* link:../ble/ble-readvalue[readValue\_&lt;type&gt;()]

 

### Defining BLE Services and Characteristics

Bluetooth data is organized into a hierarchy of services and
characteristics. Services are a collection of related characteristics.
The built-in serial service, for example, contains two characeristics
for transmitting and receiving data. Two primers that are worth reading
can be found in [Texas
Instruments](http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/Tutorial:_How_to_Create_a_Custom_Bluetooth_Smart_Embedded_Application_with_the_CC2650DK#Custom_Profile.2FService)
and
[Adafruit](https://learn.adafruit.com/introduction-to-bluetooth-low-energy/gatt#services-and-characteristics)
tutorials. Most of the details are abstracted with the data types
[`BLE_Char`](http://energia.nu/reference/ble/ble-addservice/ble_char/)
and
[`BLE_Service`](http://energia.nu/reference/ble/ble-addservice/ble_service/).
Add a service to the NP with
[ble.addService()](http://energia.nu/reference/ble/ble-addservice/).


### Error Handling

Many functions provide status and error information, either returning
`BLE_SUCCESS` or `BLE_CHECK_ERROR`, in which case the variable
[`ble.error`](http://energia.nu/?page_id=5190&preview=true) can be
checked for the specific error.

### Going Further

If you are interested in learning more about the internals of the BLE
Energia Library or would like to move to C programming with the MSP432
and CC2650MODA combo, please see the [SNP + SAP SimpleLink Academy
Module](http://software-dl.ti.com/lprf/simplelink_academy/modules/ble_snp_sap_intro/ble_snp_sap_intro.html) for
more information. For additional information on the CC2650MODA
BoosterPack or BLE, visit the support page from TI: [Embedded
BLE](http://www.ti.com/lsds/ti/wireless_connectivity/bluetooth_bluetooth-ble/simplelink-ulp-ble.page)

### Flashing the CC2650MODA BoosterPack

The Energia BLE Library depends on the CC2650MODA BoosterPack running a
Simple Network Processor image from the TI BLE SDK. You can obtain these
images for the CC2650MODA from the following links. Select the link that
corresponds to your operating system.
