== ble.addService() ==

=== Description ===

Initializes a service and its characteristics and registers them with
the NP. Services and characteristics should not be directly modified
after they are added.

=== Syntax ===

`ble.addService(&service);`

=== Parameters ===

**service**: Pointer to an instance of
link:../ble_service/[BLE_Service].
This and the contained
link:../ble_char/[BLE_Char's]
should just be statically declared and initialized by the Energia user
as shown in the example.

=== Returns ===

link:../ble_error/[Status code]

=== Example ===

      calling writeValue with a differently typed variable. */
