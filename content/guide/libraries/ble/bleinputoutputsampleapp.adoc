BLE Input Output
----------------

This app serves as an advanced demo to show the user how to create and
interact with BLE services. This app achieves most of the same
functionality as the SerialOverBLE app, but with less encapsulation. BLE
Input Output is an excellent starting point for users who are looking to
define their own services (custom or adopted), and start to use advanced
features such as security.

#### How it works

This example uses employs two BLE Services. Services (and their
underlying characteristics) are the vehicle for data transfer over BLE.
For more information about BLE Services and Characteristics, please
refer to the [SimpleLink Academy Custom Services
Module](http://software-dl.ti.com/lprf/simplelink_academy/modules/ble_01_custom_profile/ble_01_custom_profile.html).
The BLE Input Output sketch aims to communicate user input from the
MSP432 LaunchPad to a smart phone in the form of button presses.
Similarly, it takes output from the smart phone and displays it in the
form of the tri color LEDs. To do so, we must create two services, the
button service, and the LED service.

#### Creating a BLE Service

Using the BLE Energia library, you can create a service like the
simpleButtonService below:
` /* BLE LED Service is made up of LED Chars */ BLE_Char *simpleButtonServiceChars[] = {&button1Char, &button2Char};`
/\* LED Service Declaration \*/ BLE\_Service simpleButtonService = {
{0x00, 0xFF}, 2, simpleButtonServiceChars };

#### Creating a BLE Characteristic

Next, you can create the characteristics of the service as below:
` BLE_Char led1Char = { {0xF1, 0xFF}, /* 16 bit BLE UUID = 0xFFF1 */ BLE_AUTHEN | BLE_WRITABLE| BLE_READABLE, /* BLE Properties */ "LED 1" /* User Description */ };`
Notice that each characteristic has its own UUID, Properties, and User
description. These are some of the building blocks of a BLE
characteristic.

#### Making it secure

Security is a major concern for IoT devices. In this example we have
decided to make characteristic secure by adding the following tag to its
properties `BLE_AUTHEN`. This means that only authenticated users can
access this characteristic. You'll notice that when you try to read from
this characteristic, your smartphone will ask you to pair with the
device. What this means is that the CC2650MODA device is entering a
secure connection with your phone. The BLE Energia library utilizes the
latest in BLE security features (4.2 Secure Connections Pairing with
Numeric Comparison to be exact). To read more about BLE 4.2 security,
please see this blog post BLE 4.2 Security with TI. Follow along below
to learn how to securely pair your smart phone with the BLE Energia
library *Note: In order to complete the security process, you will need
to open the Energia Serial Monitor.*

1.  Open the Eneriga Serial Monitor
2.  Scan for and connect to the BLE Input Output sample app
    running Energia. It will advertise as BLE I/O Demo
3.  Once connected, attempt to read from LED 1 Char. This characteristic
    requires authentication
4.  You will notice a pop up on your smart phone asking to pair, don't
    click this just yet, but make note of the number listed on
    the popup.
5.  Look at the ouput of the Energia serial monitor, it will ask you to
    compare the number listed on your smart phone with the one on the
    serial monitor.
    1.  Press Button1 (left button on MSP432 LP) if they are equal,
        button2(left button on MSP432 LP) if they aren't.

6.  Then press pair on your phone.
7.  You will now be able to control LED1.
