== First Sketch ==

In the getting started guide (http://energia.nu/guide/guide_windows/[Windows], http://energia.nu/guide/guide_macosx/[Mac OS X], http://energia.nu/guide/guide_linux/[Linux]), you uploaded a sketch that blinks an +
LED. In this tutorial, you’ll learn how each part of that sketch works.

=== Sketch ===

A _sketch_ is the name that Energia uses for a program. It’s the unit of code that is uploaded to +
and run on a LaunchPad board.

=== Comments ===

The first few lines of the http://energia.nu/guide/tutorial_blink/[Blink] sketch are a _comment_:

----
/*
*  Blink
*  The basic Energia Example. 
*  Turns on an LED on for one second, then off for one second, repeatedly.
*  Pin 6 has an LED connected on MSP430 boards, has a name 'RED_LED' in the code.
*/
----

Everything between the `/* and */` is ignored by the LaunchPad when it runs the sketch (the * at +
the start of each line is only there to make the comment look pretty, and isn’t required). It’s +
there for people reading the code: to explain what the program does, how it works, or why it’s +
written the way it is. It’s a good practice to comment your sketches, and to keep the comments +
up-to-date when you modify the code. This helps other people to learn from or modify your +
code.

There’s another style for short, single-line comments. These start with `//` and continue to the +
end of the line. For example, in the line:

----
int ledPin = 14;  // LED connected to digital pin 14
----

the message “LED connected to digital pin 14” is a comment.

=== Variables ===

A _variable_ is a place for storing a piece of data. It has a name, a type, and a value. For example, +
the line from the Blink sketch above declares a variable with the name `ledPin`, the type `int`, and +
an initial value of 14. It’s being used to indicate which LaunchPad pin the LED is connected to. +
Every time the name `ledPin` appears in the code, its value will be retrieved. In this case, the +
person writing the program could have chosen not to bother creating the `ledPin` variable and +
instead have simply written 14 everywhere they needed to specify a pin number. The advantage +
of using a variable is that it’s easier to move the LED to a different pin: you only need to edit the +
one line that assigns the initial value to the variable.

Often, however, the value of a variable will change while the sketch runs. For example, you could +
store the value read from an input into a variable. There’s more information in the http://energia.nu/guide/variabledeclaration/[Variables + 
tutorial].

=== Functions ===

A _function_ (otherwise known as a _procedure_ or _sub-routine_) is a named piece of code that can +
be used from elsewhere in a sketch. For example, here’s the definition of the `setup()` function +
from the Blink example:

----
void setup()
{
  pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT); // sets the digital pin as output
}
----

The first line provides information about the function, like its name, “setup”. The text before +
and after the name specify its return type and parameters: these will be explained later. The +
code between the `{` and `}` is called the _body_ of the function: what the function does.

You can _call_ a function that’s already been defined (either in your sketch or as part of +
the http://energia.nu/[Energia language]). For example, the line `pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);` calls +
the `pinMode()` function, passing it two _parameters_: `ledPin` and `OUTPUT`. These parameters are +
used by the `pinMode()` function to decide which pin and mode to set.

=== pinMode(), digitalWrite(), and delay() ===

The `pinMode()` function configures a pin as either an input or an output. To use it, you pass it +
the number of the pin to configure and the constant `INPUT` or `OUTPUT`. When configured as an +
input, a pin can detect the state of a sensor like a pushbutton; this is discussed in a http://energia.nu/guide/tutorial_digitalreadserial/[later tutorial]. +
As an output, it can drive an actuator like an LED.

The `digitalWrite()` functions outputs a value on a pin. For example, the line:

----
digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH);
----

set the `ledPin(pin 14)` to `HIGH`, or ~3 volts. Writing a `LOW` to pin connects it to ground, or 0 +
volts.

The `delay()` causes the LaunchPad to wait for the specified number of milliseconds before +
continuing on to the next line. There are 1000 milliseconds in a second, so the line:

----
delay(1000);
----

creates a delay of one second.

=== setup() and loop() ===

There are two special functions that are a part of every Energia sketch: `setup()` and `loop()`. +
The `setup()` is called once, when the sketch starts. It’s a good place to do setup tasks like setting +
pin modes or initializing libraries. The `loop()` function is called over and over and is the heart of +
all sketches. You need to include both functions in your sketch, even if you don’t need them +
for anything.

=== Exercises ===

*1. Change the code so that the LED is on for 100 milliseconds and off for 1000.*

*2. Change the code so that the LED turns on when the sketch starts and stays on.*
