== Installing the LaunchPad drivers
To use Energia you will need to have the LaunchPad drivers installed. The drivers allow your PC to "see" the LaunchPad on a serial COM port when it is connected.

Energia (MT) uses a different method for building Sketches for the MSP-EXP432P401R. Because of a limitation in this method you must install Energia in a location without spaces.

If you have already used the MSP-EXP432P401R LaunchPad with TI's Code Composer Studio then you probably already have the driver installed. If not, then follow the steps below to install the driver.

. Do not connect your MSP-EXP432P401R LaunchPad to your PC. If you already plugged it into your PC then unplug it before proceeding to step 2.
. Download the LaunchPad drivers for Windows: http://s3.amazonaws.com/energiaUS/files/xds110_drivers.zip[MSP-EXP432P401R XDS110 Driver Package]
. Unzip and double click DPinst.exe for Windows 32bit or DPinst64.exe for Windows 64 bit.
. Follow the installer instructions.
. Connect your MSP-EXP432P401R LaunchPad to your PC. The MSP-EXP432P401R will be automatically recognized.
. All done, you are now ready to program the MSP-EXP432P401R with Energia.
For Windows 8 and 10 users you may need to disable your signed driver feature, follow this guide: https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/disabling-driver-signature-on-windows-8

Troubleshooting (Not seeing your Serial Port in Energia? Driver not correctly installed?)

* Make sure jumpers are connected on LaunchPad and you get a green power LED turning on when connected via USB

* Restart Energia

* Restart computer (shouldn't be required but may help)

* Right click and run DPinst.exe or DPinst64.exe as administrator
