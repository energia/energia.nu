== Sensors ==

Sensors have always been an important part of electronics and are getting even more important +
as data collection becomes one of the major jobs of embedded systems.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensor[Sensors] are hardware devices that produce a measurable response to a change in a physical +
condition like temperature or pressure. Sensors measure physical data of the parameter to be +
monitored. The continual https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog_signal[analog signal] produced by the sensors is digitized by an https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog-to-digital_converter[analog-to- +
digital] converter and sent to controllers for further processing. A sensor node should be small in +
size, consume extremely low energy, operate in high volumetric densities, be autonomous and +
operate unattended, and be adaptive to the environment. As wireless sensor nodes are typically +
very small electronic devices, they can only be equipped with a limited power source of less than +
0.5-2 ampere-hour and 1.2-3.7 volts.

Sensors are classified into three categories: passive, omni-directional sensors; passive, narrow- +
beam sensors; and active sensors. Passive sensors sense the data without actually manipulating +
the environment by active probing. They are self powered; that is, energy is needed only to +
amplify their analog signal. Active sensors actively probe the environment, for example, a sonar +
or radar sensor, and they require continuous energy from a power source. Narrow-beam sensors +
have a well-defined notion of direction of measurement, similar to a camera. Omni-directional +
sensors have no notion of direction involved in their measurements.
