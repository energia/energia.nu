== MultiBlink ==

This example shows how to blink LEDs at different rates using multitasking in Energia MT.

=== Hardware Required ===

* MSP432P401R LaunchPad (Or any other LaunchPad that supports multi tasking. The analog pins input pin numbers might need to be changed to those that match the LaunchPad you are using).

=== Relevant groundwork ===

None

=== Circuit ===

Only your LaunchPad Board is needed for this example.

=== Code Explanation ===

This multitasking example is based on the basic http://energia.nu/guide/tutorial_blink/[Blink Example], but adds multitasking functionality to blink multiple LEDs at different rates.  Each tab in the sketch is a different task with their own setup and loop functions. All the setup and loop functions must have matching name pairs for the ROTS compiler to recognize them as tasks.

----
void setupBlueLed(), void loopBlueLed()
void setupGreenLed(), void loopGreenLed()
void setupRedLed(), void loopRedLed()
----

Each of the three tabs will execute as separate tasks, toggling the LED at a rate of 100, 500, and 1000 milliseconds respectively.  During the `delay()` functions, the RTOS will automatically put the MCU into deep sleep mode to conserve power.

=== Code ===

*Tab 1*

----
#undef LED
#define LED BLUE_LED

void setupBlueLed() {
 pinMode(LED, OUTPUT);
}

// the loop routine runs over and over again forever as a task.
void loopBlueLed() {
 digitalWrite(LED, HIGH); // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
 delay(100); // wait for 100 ms
 digitalWrite(LED, LOW); // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
 delay(100); // wait for 100 ms
}
----

*Tab 2*

----
#undef LED
#define LED GREEN_LED

void setupGreenLed() {
 // initialize the digital pin as an output.
 pinMode(LED, OUTPUT);
}

// the loop routine runs over and over again forever as a task.
void loopGreenLed() {
 digitalWrite(LED, HIGH); // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
 delay(500); // wait for half a second
 digitalWrite(LED, LOW); // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
 delay(500); // wait for half a second
}
----

*Tab 3*

----
#undef LED
#define LED RED_LED

void setupRedLed() {
 // initialize the digital pin as an output.
 pinMode(LED, OUTPUT);
}

// the loop routine runs over and over again forever as a task.
void loopRedLed() {
 digitalWrite(LED, HIGH); // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
 delay(1000); // wait for a second
 digitalWrite(LED, LOW); // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
 delay(1000); // wait for a second
}
