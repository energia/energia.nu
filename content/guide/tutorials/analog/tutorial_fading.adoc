== Fading ==

Demonstrates the use of analog output (link://tutorial_pwm/[Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)]) to fade an LED. PWM is a technique for getting an analog-like behavior from a digital output by switching it off and on very fast.

=== Hardware Required ===

* MSP-EXP430G2 LaunchPad
* 10k ohm resistor
* Breadboard
* Hook-up wire
* LED (available on-board)

=== Relevant Groundwork ===

An LED connected to digital output pin 14 through a 220-ohm resistor. Note that pin 14 is connected to the green LED on the MSP-EXP430G2 LaunchPad. Also, it is important to note that not all pins on the LaunchPad are capable of generating a PWM signal using the `analogWrite()` function. To see all of the pins that support `analogWrite()`, visit the link://pinmapping/[Energia pin-mapping guide.]

void loop()  {
  // fade in from min to max in increments of 5 points:
  for(int fadeValue = 0 ; fadeValue <= 255; fadeValue +=5) {
    // sets the value (range from 0 to 255):
    analogWrite(ledPin, fadeValue);
    // wait for 30 milliseconds to see the dimming effect
    delay(30);
  }

  // fade out from max to min in increments of 5 points:
  for(int fadeValue = 255 ; fadeValue >= 0; fadeValue -=5) {
    // sets the value (range from 0 to 255):
    analogWrite(ledPin, fadeValue);
    // wait for 30 milliseconds to see the dimming effect
