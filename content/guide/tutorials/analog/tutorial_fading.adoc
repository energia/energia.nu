== Fading ==

Demonstrates the use of analog output (http://energia.nu/guide/tutorial_pwm/[Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)]) to fade an LED. PWM is a technique for getting an analog-like behavior from a digital output by switching it off and on very fast.

=== Hardware Required ===

* MSP-EXP430G2 LaunchPad
* 10k ohm resistor
* Breadboard
* Hook-up wire
* LED (available on-board)
 
=== Relevant Groundwork ===

An LED connected to digital output pin 14 through a 220-ohm resistor. Note that pin 14 is connected to the green LED on the MSP-EXP430G2 LaunchPad. Also, it is important to note that not all pins on the LaunchPad are capable of generating a PWM signal using the `analogWrite()` function. To see all of the pins that support `analogWrite()`, visit the http://energia.nu/guide/pinmapping/[Energia pin-mapping guide.]

  // fade in from min to max in increments of 5 points:

    // sets the value (range from 0 to 255):
    analogWrite(ledPin, fadeValue);         
    // wait for 30 milliseconds to see the dimming effect    
    delay(30);                            
  } 

  // fade out from max to min in increments of 5 points:
  for(int fadeValue = 255 ; fadeValue >= 0; fadeValue -=5) { 
    // sets the value (range from 0 to 255):
    analogWrite(ledPin, fadeValue);
