== Analog In, Out Serial ==

This example shows how to read an analog input pin, map the result to a range from 0 to 255, +
and then use that result to set the pulsewidth modulation (PWM) of an output pin to dim or +
brighten an LED.

=== Hardware Required ===

* MSP-EXP430G2 LaunchPad
* Potentiometer
* LED
* 220 ohm resistor

=== Relevant Groundwork ===

Connect one pin from your pot to 3V, the center pin to analog channel A3 (pin 5), and the +
remaining pin to ground. Next, connect a 220 ohm current limiting resistor to digital pin 2, with +
an LED in series. The long, positive leg (the anode) of the LED should be connected to the +
output from the resistor, with the shorter, negative leg (the cathode) connected to ground.

=== Code Explanation ===

In the program below, after declaring two pin assignments (analog channel A3 for your +
potentiometer and digital pin 2 for your LED) and two variables, `sensorValue` and `outputValue`, +
the only thing that you do will in the setup function is to begin serial communication.

Next, in the main loop of the code, `sensorValue` is assigned to store the raw analog value coming +
in from the potentiometer. Because the LaunchPad has an `analogRead` resolution of 0-1023, and +
an `analogWrite` resolution of only 0-255, this raw data from the potentiometer needs to be +
scaled before using it to dim the LED.

In order to scale this value, use a function called http://energia.nu/reference/map/[map()].

----
outputValue = map(sensorValue, 0, 1023, 0, 255);
----

`outputValue` is assigned to equal the scaled value from the potentiometer. `map()` accepts five +
arguments: The value to be mapped, the low range and high range of the raw data, and the low +
and high values for that data to be scaled too. In this case, the sensor data is mapped down from  + 
its original range of 0 to 1023 to 0 to 255.

The newly mapped sensor data is then output to the `analogOutPin` dimming or brightening the +
LED as the potentiometer is turned. Finally, both the raw and scaled sensor values are sent to +
the Energia serial window in a steady stream of data.

  Analog input, analog output, serial output

 Reads an analog input pin, maps the result to a range from 0 to 255
 and uses the result to set the pulsewidth modulation (PWM) of an output pin.
 Also prints the results to the serial monitor.

 The circuit:
 * potentiometer connected to analog channel A3.
   Center pin of the potentiometer goes to the analog pin.
   side pins of the potentiometer go to ~3V and ground
 * LED connected from digital pin 2 to ground
