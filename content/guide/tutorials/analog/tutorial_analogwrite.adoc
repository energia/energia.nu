== Analog Write with 7 LEDs that are tied to the analogWrite-capable pins on the MSP-EXP430G2 LaunchPad ==

This example fades 7 LEDs up and the down, one by one, on an MSP-EXP430G2 LaunchPad.

=== Hardware Required ===

* MSP-EXP430G2 LaunchPad
* (7) LEDs
* (7) 220 ohm resistors
* Hook up wire
* Breadboard

=== Relevant Groundwork ===

Connect the longer, positive legs of (anodes) 7 LEDs to digital pins 4, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 19 through 220 ohm current limiting resistors. Connect the shorter, negative legs (cathodes) to ground.

=== Code Explanation ===

In the `setup()` function of the code below, a http://energia.nu/reference/for/[`for()`] loop is used to assign digital pins 4, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 19 of the LaunchPad as outputs.

Next, in the `loop()` function of the program below, a trio of nested `for()` loops are used.

The first of these loops,

----
for (int thisPin =0; analogWritePin[thisPin] <= 7; thisPin++)
----

moves through each of the LEDS one by one, from the lowest pin to the highest. Before this loop is allowed to move from one pin to the next, two things must be accomplished. First, you brighten the individual LED through these lines of code:

----
for (int brightness = 0; brightness < 255; brightness++) {
      analogWrite(analogWritePin[thisPin], brightness);
      delay(2);
}
----

With each pass through the loop above, the variable brightness increases by one point, and that value is written to the pin currently selected to the main loop. One that pin reaches the maximum PWM value (255), the following loop kicks in:

----
for (int brightness = 255; brightness >= 0; brightness--) {
      analogWrite(analogWritePin[thisPin], brightness);
      delay(2);
}
----

This loop subtracts a point from the brightness variable, dimming the LED back down to 0. Once zero is reached, the main `for()` loop kicks in, and the program moves on to the next LED pin, repeating all the steps mentioned above.
