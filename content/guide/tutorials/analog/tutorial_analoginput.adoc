== Analog Input ==

A potentiometer is a simple knob that provides a variable resistance, which you can read into the LaunchPad board as an analog value. In this example, you'll connect a potentiometer to one of the LaunchPad's analog inputs to control the rate at which the built-in LED on pin 2 blinks.

=== Hardware Required ===

* MSP430 LaunchPad
* Potentiometer
* Built-in LED on pin 2

=== Relevant Groundwork ===

Connect three wires to the LaunchPad board. The first goes to ground from one of the outer pins of the potentiometer. The second goes from ~3 volts to the other outer pin of the potentiometer. The third goes from analog input A3 to the middle pin of the potentiometer.

For this example, it is possible to use the LaunchPad board's built in LED attached to pin 2. To use an additional LED, attach its longer leg (the positive leg, or anode), to digital pin 2, and it's shorter leg (the negative leg, or cathode) to the ground (gnd) pin next to pin 2. Because of the low amount of current coming from digital pin 2, it is not necessary to use a current limiting resistor in this particular case.

=== Code Explanation ===

In the beginning of this program, the variable `sensorPin` is set to to analog channel A3, where your potentiometer is attached, and `ledPin` is set to digital pin 2. You'll also create another variable, `sensorValue i` to store the values read from your sensor.

The `analogRead()` command converts the input voltage range, 0 to ~3 volts, to a digital value between 0 and 1023. This is done by a circuit inside the LaunchPad called an *analog-to-digital* *converter* or *ADC*.

By turning the shaft of the potentiometer, you change the amount of resistance on either side of the center pin (or wiper) of the potentiometer. This changes the relative resistances between the center pin and the two outside pins, giving you a different voltage at the analog input. When the shaft is turned all the way in one direction, there is no resistance between the center pin and the pin connected to ground. The voltage at the center pin then is 0 volts, `andanalogRead()` returns 0. When the shaft is turned all the way in the other direction, there is no resistance between the center pin and the pin connected to ~3 volts. The voltage at the center pin then is ~3 volts, and `analogRead()` returns 1023. In between, http://energia.nu/AnalogRead[`analogRead()`] returns a number between 0 and 1023 that is proportional to the amount of voltage being applied to the pin.

That value, stored in `sensorValue`, is used to set a `delay()` for your blink cycle. The higher the value, the longer the cycle, the smaller the value, the shorter the cycle.

/*
  Analog Input
  Demonstrates analog input by reading an analog sensor on analog channel A3 and
  turning on and off a light emitting diode(LED)  connected to digital pin 2. 
  The amount of time the LED will be on and off depends on
  the value obtained by analogRead(). 

  The circuit:
  * Potentiometer attached to analog channel A3
  * center pin of the potentiometer to the analog pin
  * one side pin (either one) to ground
  * the other side pin to ~3V
  * LED anode (long leg) attached to digital output 2
  * LED cathode (short leg) attached to ground

  * Note: MSP430 LaunchPad has a built-in LED attached 
    to pin 2 on the board, the LED is optional.
