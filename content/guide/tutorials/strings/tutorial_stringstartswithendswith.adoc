== String StartsWith and EndsWith Functions ==

The String functions http://energia.nu/StringStartsWith.html[`startsWith()`] and http://energia.nu/StringEndsWith.html[`endsWith()`] allow you to check what character or substring a given String starts or ends with. They're basically special cases of http://energia.nu/StringSubstring.html[substring].

=== Code Explanation ===

`startsWith()` and `endsWith()` can be used to look for a particular message header, or for a single character at the end of a String. They can also be used with an offset to look for a substring starting at a particular position. For example:

----
  stringOne = "HTTP/1.1 200 OK";
  if (stringOne.startsWith("200 OK", 9)) {
    Serial.println("Got an OK from the server"); 
  }
---- 

This is functionally the same as this:

----
  stringOne = "HTTP/1.1 200 OK";
  if (stringOne.substring(9) == "200 OK") {
    Serial.println("Got an OK from the server"); 
  }
----

*Caution:* If you look for a position that's outside the range of the string,you'll get unpredictable results. For example, in the example above `stringOne.startsWith(''200 OK'', 16)` wouldn't check against the String itself, but whatever is in memory just beyond it. For best results, make sure the index values you use for `startsWith` and `endsWith` are between 0 and the String's `length()`.

    Serial.println("Server's using http version 1.1");

  stringOne = "HTTP/1.1 200 OK";
  if (stringOne.startsWith("200 OK", 9)) {
    Serial.println("Got an OK from the server"); 
  } 

  // endsWith() checks to see if a String ends with a particular character:
  String sensorReading = "sensor = ";
  sensorReading += analogRead(A0);
  Serial.print (sensorReading);
  if (sensorReading.endsWith(0)) {
    Serial.println(". This reading is divisible by ten");

    Serial.println(". This reading is not divisible by ten");

  while(true);
