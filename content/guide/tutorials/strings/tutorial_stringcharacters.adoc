== String Character Functions ==

The String functions `charAt()` and `setCharAt()` are used to get or set the value of a character at a given position in a String.

=== Relevant Groundwork ===

At their simplest, these functions help you search and replace a given character. For example, the following replaces the colon in a given String with an equals sign:

----
 String reportString = "SensorReading: 456";
 int colonPosition = reportString.indexOf(':');
 reportString.setCharAt(colonPosition, '=');
---- 

Here's an example that checks to see if the first letter of the second word is 'B':

----
 String reportString = "Franklin, Benjamin";
 int spacePosition = reportString.indexOf(' ');
 if (reportString.charAt(spacePosition + 1) == 'B') {
    Serial.println("You might have found the Benjamins.")
 }
----

*Caution:* If you try to get the `charAt` or try to `setCharAt()` a value that's longer than the String's length, you'll get unexpected results. If you're not sure, check to see that the position you want to set or get is less than the string's length using the `length()` function.

=== Code Explanation ===

In the program, we take pull a character from one string and append it to the end of another string. We then replace the character in position 13 of the first string with an `'='`.

* Set one string as all the letter of the alphabet, pull out the vowels, and print to serial.
