== String Substring Function ==

The String function link:/reference/en/language/variables/data-types/string/functions/substring/[`substring()`] is closely related to link:/reference/en/language/variables/data-types/string/functions/setchartat/[`charAt()`], link:/reference/en/language/variables/data-types/string/functions/startswith/[`startsWith()`] and link:/reference/en/language/variables/data-types/string/functions/endswith/[`endsWith()`]. It allows you to look for an instance of a particular substring within a given String.

=== Code Explanation ===

`substring()` with only one parameter looks for a given substring from the position given to the end of the string. It expects that the substring extends all the way to the end of the String. For example:

----
  String stringOne = "Content-Type: text/html";

  // substring(index) looks for the substring from the index position to the end:
  if (stringOne.substring(19) == "html") {
   }

  //is true, while 

  String stringOne = "Content-Type: text/html";

  // substring(index) looks for the substring from the index position to the end:
  if (stringOne.substring(19) == "htm") {
   }

  //is not true, because there's 1 after the htm in the String.
---- 

`substring()` with two parameters looks for a given substring from the first parameter to the second. For example:

----
  String stringOne = "Content-Type: text/html";

  // you can also look for a substring in the middle of a string:
  if (stringOne.substring(14,18) == "text") {

  }
----

This looks for the word text from positions 14 through 18 of the String.

*Caution:* make sure your index values are within the String's length or you'll get unpredictable results. This kind of error can be particularly hard to find with the second instance of `substring()` 
if the starting position is less than the String's length, but the ending position isn't.
