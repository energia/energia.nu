== Serial Call and Response (handshaking) ==

This example demonstrates multi-byte communication from the MSP430 LaunchPad to the computer using a call-and-response (handshaking) method. This sketch sends an ASCII A (byte of value 65) on startup and repeats that until it gets a serial response from the computer. Then it sends three sensor values as single bytes, and waits for another response from the computer. You can use the Energia serial monitor to view the sent data, or it can be read by Processing (see code below).

=== Hardware Required ===

* MSP-EXP430G2 LaunchPad
* Two potentiometers
* Momentary switch/button
* Three 10K ohm resistors
* Breadboard
* Hook-up wire

=== Relevant Groundwork ===

In this code, we use the function link:/reference/en/language/functions/communication/serial/write/[`Serial.write()`]. This function writes the value of what is in the function as binary data to the Serial Monitor. For instance if we put `Serial.write(100)`; into Energia sketch, when we open the Serial monitor, we will see a string of `'d'` written on the Serial Monitor which 100 in decimal corresponds to `'d'` in ASCII.

Connect analog sensors to analog input pin 0 and 1 with 10K ohm resistors used as voltage dividers. Connect a pushbutton or switch to digital I/O pin 2 with a 10Kohm resistor as a reference to ground.

=== Code Explanation ===

*Energia*

At the start of the program, the Serial Monitor will display a string of `'A'` until another ASCII character is written in the Serial Monitor. Once another character is received, the values of the three sensor attached to the LaunchPad will be displayed on the Serial Monitor as ASCII characters.

*Processing*

The Processing code will display a window with a grey circle inside. Changing the sensors will change the position of the grey circle inside the Processing window.

  Serial Call and Response

  This program sends an ASCII A (byte of value 65) on startup
  and repeats that until it gets some data in.
  Then it waits for a byte in the serial port, and
  sends three sensor values whenever it gets a byte in.

  Thanks to Greg Shakar and Scott Fitzgerald for the improvements

  The circuit:
  * potentiometers attached to analog inputs 0 and 1
  * pushbutton attached to digital I/O 11
