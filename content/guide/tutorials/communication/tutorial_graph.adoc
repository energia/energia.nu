== Graph ==

This example shows you how to send a byte of data from the MSP430 LaunchPad to a personal computer and graph the result. This is called serial communication because the connection appears to both the LaunchPad and the computer as a serial port, even though it may actually use a USB cable.ou can use the Energia serial monitor to view the sent data, or it can be read by Processing.

=== Hardware Required ===

* MSP-EXP430G2 LaunchPad
* A variable resistor, like a potentiometer

=== Relevant Groundwork ===

We can connect analog sensors to the MSP430 through the 8 analog read pins. You can view the pin mapping link://pinmapping/[here] for the mapping for the particular MSP430 device you are using on the LaunchPad. The Launchpad will read the analog signal coming from the device and send it to the analog to digital converter in the microcontroller. We can read these digital values in the Serial Monitor in Energia.

Connect a potentiometer or other analog sensor to analog input 3.

=== Code Explanation ===

*Energia*

The first step is to set up Serial communication between the LaunchPad and the Serial monitor. We accomplish this through the `Serial.begin()` function. We set up communication to 9600 bits of data per second. In the `loop()` function, we use `Serial.println()` to print out the output to the Serial monitor in Energia. `analogRead(A3)` inside the `Serial.println()` looks at the analog signal being read from the potentiometer connected to analog pin 3. We add a delay at the end of this function to stabilize the analog to digital converter after we read the last reading.

*Processing*

It is important to note that when using Processing, you have to first flash your Energia code onto the LaunchPad. Processing will be calling upon the device connected to the COM port that your LaunchPad is connected to in order to read the value of the potentiometer to output to the graph generated by the Processing code.

  Graph

  A simple example of communication from the Launchpad to the computer:
  the value of analog input 0 is sent out the serial port. We call this "serial"
  communication because the connection appears to both the Launchpad and the
  computer as a serial port, even though it may actually use
  a USB cable. Bytes are sent one after another (serially) from the Launchpad
  to the computer.

  You can use the Energia serial monitor to view the sent data, or it can
  be read by Processing or another program capable of reading
  data from a serial port. The Processing code below graphs the data received
  so you can see the value of the analog input changing over time.

  The circuit:
  Any analog input sensor can be attached to an analog pin.
  For this example, a potentiometer is attached to analog pin 3.
