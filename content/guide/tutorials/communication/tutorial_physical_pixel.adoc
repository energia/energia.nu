This example uses the MSP430 Launchpad to receive data from the computer. The Launchpad turns on an LED when it receives the character 'H', and turns off the LED when it receives the character 'L'. The data can be sent from the Energia serial monitor, or another program like Processing (see code below).

=== Hardware Required ===

* MSP-EXP430G2 LaunchPad
* LED [on-board as part of the LaunchPad]

=== Relevant Groundwork ===

For this example, it is easier to use the built-in LED on the LaunchPad corresponding to Pin 2 for Red or Pin 14 for Green. You can attach an LED externally to pin 9 on the Launchpad where the long leg, or anode, goes to pin 9. The short leg, or cathode, goes to ground.

=== Code Explanation ===

*Energia*

The LaunchPad will look for ASCII characters that will be sent from the Energia Serial Monitor in order to turn an LED on the LaunchPad board on (High) or off (Low). When an 'H' is written in the Serial Monitor, the LED will turn on, when an 'L' is written into the monitor, the LED will turn off. We begin by initializing a constant (in this code `ledPin`) to the value of 14 or the pin associated with the Green LED on the LaunchPad board. We also need a new variable called `incomingByte` that will save the ASCII character read by the Serial Monitor.

In the `setup()` section, we initialize link:/reference/en/language/functions/communication/serial/[Serial] communication and set the pin associated to the Green LED (Pin 14) as an output.

In the `loop()` section, link:/reference/en/language/functions/communication/serial/available/[`Serial.available()`] will look for characters read from the Serial Monitor. This is inside an if statement that will continuously run while the Serial is available. We set our variable `incomingByte` to what is being read from the Serial Monitor. There are 2 if statements that follow. The first controls what will happen when an 'H' is read in the Serial Monitor. If an 'H' is received, it will set the Green LED High using the `digitalWrite()` function. The second if statement controls what happens when an 'L' is received. Very similar to the previous statement, only difference is when 'L' is seen, the LED goes Low.

*Processing*

The Processing code will send data to the COM port to control what happens to the LED. The Processing code generates a window that has a grey box inside surrounded by a blackbackground. When you place your mouse cursor into the grey box, Processing will send 'H' to the port enabling the Green LED to go high. When the cursor is not in the grey box, Processing will send 'L' to the port turning the LED low.
