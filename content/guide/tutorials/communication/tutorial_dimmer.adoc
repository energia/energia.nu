This example shows how to send data from a personal computer to a the MSP430 LaunchPad, to control the brightness +
of an LED. The data is sent in individual bytes, each of which ranges in value from 0 to 255. The LaunchPad reads these +
bytes and uses them to set the brightness of the LED. You can send bytes to the LaunchPad from any software that can +
access the computer serial port. Example for https://www.processing.org/[Processing] is shown below.

=== Hardware Required ===

* MSP-EXP430G2 LaunchPad
* LED
* 220 ohm resistor

=== Relevant Groundwork ===

The Serial Monitor in Energia, allows you to send and read information between the Launchpad and the computer +
connected to it.

A Green LED is connected to pin 14 on the Launchpad. Use an appropriate resistor as needed if connecting an LED +
from a Breadboard. For most common LEDs, you can usually do without the resistor, as the current output of the +
digital I/O pins is limited.

=== Code Explanation ===

The Processing sketch in the code sample below will send bytes out the serial port to the LaunchPad to dim the LED.

  Demonstrates the sending data from the computer to the Launchpad,
  in this case to control the brightness of an LED. The data is sent
  in individual bytes, each of which ranges from 0 to 255. The Launchpad
  reads these bytes and uses them to set the brightness of the LED.

  The circuit:
  LED attached from digital pin 2 to ground.
  Serial connection to Processing, Max/MSP, or another serial application
