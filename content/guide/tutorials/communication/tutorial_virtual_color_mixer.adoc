== Virtual Color Mixer ==

This example demonstrates how to send multiple values from the MSP430 LaunchPad to the computer. The readings from three potentiometers are used to set the red, green, and blue components of the background color of a Processing sketch.

=== Hardware Required ===

* MSP-EXP430G2 LaunchPad
* Three potentiometers
* Three 10K ohm resistors
* Breadboard
* Hook-up wire

=== Relevant Groundwork ===

The sensor values are sent from the LaunchPad to the computer as http://www.tigoe.net/pcomp/code/communication/interpreting-serial-data-bytes[ASCII-encoded decimal numbers]. This means that each number is sent using the ASCII characters "0" through "9". For the value "234" for example, three bytes are sent: ASCII "2" (binary value 50), ASCII "3" (binary value 51), and ASCII "4" (binary value 52).

Connect analog sensors to analog input pins `A0, A1,` and `A2`. This circuit uses three http://www.tigoe.net/pcomp/code/input-output/analog-input[voltage divider] sub-circuits to generate analog voltages from the force-sensing resistors. A voltage divider has two resistors in series, dividing the voltage proportionally to their values.

=== Code Explanation ===

*Energia*

The Energia code is straightforward for the most part. We first initialize our variables named `redPin`, `greenPin`, and `bluePin` to read the analog sensor attached to the specific pin. The `setup()` section begins the Serial communication. The `loop()` section we display the values from the analog signal on the Serial Monitor. We can check to see if the analog sensors are sending signals to the LaunchPad.

*Processing*

In Processing, the code generates a window that will change color according to the values set from the analog sensors. Each analog sensor is tied to a Red, Green, or Blue color and when the sensors are changed, the three colors are mixed together and the output of the sensor values will change the color on the Processing window.

  This example reads three analog sensors (potentiometers are easiest)
  and sends their values serially. The Processing code at the bottom
  take those three values and use them to change the background color of the screen.
