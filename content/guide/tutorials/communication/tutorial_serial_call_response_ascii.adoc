== Serial Call and Response (handshaking) with ASCII-encoded output ==

This example demonstrates string-based communication from the MSP430LaunchPad to the computer using a call-and-response (handshaking) method. The sketch sends an ASCII string on startup and repeats that until it gets a serial response from the computer. Then it sends three sensor values as ASCII-encoded numbers, separated by commas and terminated by a linefeed and carriage return, and waits for another response from the computer.

You can use the Energia serial monitor to view the sent data, or it can be read by Processing (see code below). The example below splits the incoming string on the commas and convert the string into numbers again.

Compare this to the http://energia.nu/Tutorial_SerialCallResponses.html[Serial call and response]. They are similar, in that both use a handshaking method, but this one encodes the sensor readings as strings, while the other sends them as binary values. While sending as ASCII-encoded strings takes more bytes, it means you can easily send values larger than 255 for each sensor reading. It's also easier to read in a serial terminal program.

=== Hardware Required ===

* MSP-EXP430G2 LaunchPad
* Two potentiometers
* Momentary switch/button
* Three 10K ohm resistors
* Breadboard
* Hook-up wire

=== Relevant Groundwork ===

In this code, we use the function `Serial.print()`. This function writes the value of what is in the function as readable ASCII text. For instance if we put `Serial.write(100)`; into Energia sketch, when we open the Serial monitor, we will see a string of "100" written on the Serial Monitor. We can also write words to the Serial Monitor using `Serial.print()`. For instance `Serial.print("Hello")`; will return "Hello" on the Serial Monitor. With `Serial.print()` you can also change the base you want to read the value in the function. For example, `Serial.print(78, BIN)` will show "1001110" on the Serial Monitor.

Connect analog sensors to analog input pin 0 and 1 with 10K ohm resistors used as voltage dividers. Connect a pushbutton or switch to digital I/O pin 2 with a 10Kohm resistor as a reference to ground.

=== Code Explanation ===

*Energia*

This code is very similar to the Serial Call and Response example. The main difference is we read the sensor values from the LaunchPad as ASCII-encoded-numbers instead of binary values as was the case from the previous Serial Call and Response which make them easier to read in the Serial Monitor.

*Processing*

The Processing code is also similar to the Serial Call and Response example in which you change the position of the circle produced by Processing by changing the sensors connected to the LaunchPad.

/*
  Serial Call and Response in ASCII

  This program sends an ASCII A (byte of value 65) on startup
  and repeats that until it gets some data in.
  Then it waits for a byte in the serial port, and
  sends three ASCII-encoded, comma-separated sensor values,
  truncated by a linefeed and carriage return,
  whenever it gets a byte in.

  Thanks to Greg Shakar and Scott Fitzgerald for the improvements

  The circuit:
  * potentiometers attached to analog inputs 0 and 1
  * pushbutton attached to digital I/O 2
