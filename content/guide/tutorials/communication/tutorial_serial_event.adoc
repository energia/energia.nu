=== Code Explanation ===

This code demonstrates the use of the `serialEvent()` function. In this code, `serialEvent()` runs after each time `loop()` processes. Since we are placing characters read from the Serial Monitor into a buffer, the `serialEvent` will send characters received back into the main loop to be processed. The best way to demonstrate this is to place a delay at the end of the if statement in the main loop. The string read from the Serial monitor will be printed to the serial monitor with a delay. During the delay, if you type more characters into the Serial Monitor, the code will send these characters back into the main loop after the delay to be printed to the Serial Monitor.

  Serial Event example

  When new serial data arrives, this sketch adds it to a String.
  When a newline is received, the loop prints the string and
  clears it.

  A good test for this is to try it with a GPS receiver
  that sends out NMEA 0183 sentences.

  SerialEvent occurs whenever a new data comes in the

  time loop() runs, so using delay inside loop can delay
  response. Multiple bytes of data may be available.

    // add it to the inputString:
