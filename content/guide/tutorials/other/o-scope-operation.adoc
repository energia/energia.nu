Learn digital oscillsocope fundamentals and how to use it for signal analysis using 22 lab +
experiments.

These 22 Lab Experiments are organized under 6 courses â€“ each course focusing on specific +
features of oscilloscope:

* Amplitude Measurement
* Timing Measurement
* Advanced Measurement
* Triggering
* Waveform Math
* Cursor Measurement


MSP430 is a popular Embedded Hardware platform from Texas Instruments (TI) for rapid +
prototyping of low -cost, low-power embedded system designs. MSP430 LaunchPad board can +
be used for conducting these experiments as Device Under Test (DUT). MSP430 code (that runs +
on Energia IDE), required for programming of the board to generate signals, is also provided +
along with the lab package.
