== For Loop (aka The Knight Rider) ==

A for loop is a section of code that repeat until a conditional is met. Usually this is based on a +
counter that you define in a code. For example, run this code as long as the counter is under 100 +
and each time through the loop increment the counter by one. If we intialize the counter to zero +
in the beginning, then the loop will run through 100 iterations of the code before exiting the +
loop and continuing on with the rest of program.

=== Hardware Required ===

* MSP430 LaunchPad
* (9) 220 ohm resistors
* (9) LEDs
* Hook-up wire
* Breadboard
 
=== Relevant Groundwork ===

Often you want to iterate over a series of pins and do something to each one. For instance, this +
example blinks 9 LEDsattached the LaunchPad by using a http://energia.nu/reference/for/[`*for()*`] loop to cycle back and forth +
through digital pins 2-10. The LEDS are turned on and off, in sequence, by using both +
the http://energia.nu/reference/digitalwrite/[`digitalWrite()`] and http://energia.nu/reference/delay/[`delay()`] functions.

We also call this example https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KITT[“Knight Rider”] in memory of a TV-series from the 80’s where David +
Hasselhoff had an AI machine named KITT driving his Pontiac. The car had been augmented +
with plenty of LEDs in all possible sizes performing flashy effects. In particular, it had a display +
that scanned back and forth across a line. This example duplicates the KITT display.

=== Circuit ===

Connect nine LEDS, with 220 ohm resistors in series, to digital pins 2-10 on your LaunchPad.

=== Code Explanation ===

The code below begins by utilizing a `for()` loop to assign digital pins 2-10 as outputs for the +
9 LEDs used.

In the main loop of the code, two `for()` loops are used to loop incrementally, stepping through +
the LEDs, one by one, from pin 2 to pin 10. Once pin 10 is lit, the process reverses, stepping back +
down through each LED.
