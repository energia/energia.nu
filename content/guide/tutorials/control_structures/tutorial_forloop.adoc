== For Loop (aka The Knight Rider) ==

A for loop is a section of code that repeat until a conditional is met. Usually this is based on a counter that you define in a code. For example, run this code as long as the counter is under 100 and each time through the loop increment the counter by one. If we intialize the counter to zero in the beginning, then the loop will run through 100 iterations of the code before exiting the loop and continuing on with the rest of program.

=== Hardware Required ===

* MSP430 LaunchPad
* (9) 220 ohm resistors
* (9) LEDs
* Hook-up wire
* Breadboard
 
=== Relevant Groundwork ===

Often you want to iterate over a series of pins and do something to each one. For instance, this example blinks 9 LEDsattached the LaunchPad by using a http://energia.nu/reference/for/[`*for()*`] loop to cycle back and forth through digital pins 2-10. The LEDS are turned on and off, in sequence, by using both the http://energia.nu/reference/digitalwrite/[`digitalWrite()`] and http://energia.nu/reference/delay/[`delay()`] functions.

We also call this example https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KITT[''Knight Rider''] in memory of a TV-series from the 80's where David Hasselhoff had an AI machine named KITT driving his Pontiac. The car had been augmented with plenty of LEDs in all possible sizes performing flashy effects. In particular, it had a display that scanned back and forth across a line. This example duplicates the KITT display.

=== Circuit ===

Connect nine LEDS, with 220 ohm resistors in series, to digital pins 2-10 on your LaunchPad.

=== Code Explanation ===

The code below begins by utilizing a `for()` loop to assign digital pins 2-10 as outputs for the 9 LEDs used.

In the main loop of the code, two `for()` loops are used to loop incrementally, stepping through the LEDs, one by one, from pin 2 to pin 10. Once pin 10 is lit, the process reverses, stepping back down through each LED.
