== Switch (case) Statement, used with sensor input ==

Switch statements allow mulitple choices in which sections of code to run for a given conditional.

=== Hardware Required ===

* MSP430 LaunchPad
* (1) photocell, or analog sensor
* (1) 10k ohm resistors
* Breadboard
* Hook-up wire

=== Relevant Groundwork ===

An if statement allows you to choose between two discrete options, `TRUE` or `FALSE`. When there are more than two options, you can use multiple if statements, or you can use the link:/guide/tutorials/control_structures/tutorial_switchcase/[*switch*] statement. Switch allows you to choose between several discrete options. This tutorial shows you how to use it to switch between four desired states of a photo resistor: really dark, dim, medium, and bright.

This program first reads the photoresistor. Then it uses the `map()` function to map its output to one of four values: 0, 1, 2, or 3. Finally, it uses the `switch()` statement to print one of four messages back to the computer depending on which of the four values is returned.

The photoresistor is connected to analog in pin `A3` using a voltage divider circuit. A 10Kilohm resistor makes up the other side of the voltage divider, running from analog in `A3` to ground. The `analogRead()` function returns a range of about 0 to 600 from this circuit in a reasonably lit indoor space.

/*
  Switch statement

  Demonstrates the use of a switch statement.  The switch
  statement allows you to choose from among a set of discrete values
  of a variable.  It's like a series of if statements.

  To see this sketch in action, but the board and sensor in a well-lit
  room, open the serial monitor, and and move your hand gradually
  down over the sensor.

  The circuit:
  * photoresistor from analog in 0 to +3V
  * 10K resistor from analog in 0 to ground

// these constants won't change. They are the
// lowest and highest readings you get from your sensor:
const int sensorMin = 0;      // sensor minimum, discovered through experiment
const int sensorMax = 600;    // sensor maximum, discovered through experiment

void setup() {
  // initialize serial communication:
  Serial.begin(9600);  
}

void loop() {
  // read the sensor:
  int sensorReading = analogRead(A3);
  // map the sensor range to a range of four options:
  int range = map(sensorReading, sensorMin, sensorMax, 0, 3);

  // do something different depending on the 
  // range value:
  switch (range) {
  case 0:    // your hand is on the sensor
    Serial.println("dark");
    break;
  case 1:    // your hand is close to the sensor
    Serial.println("dim");
    break;
  case 2:    // your hand is a few inches from the sensor
    Serial.println("medium");
    break;
  case 3:    // your hand is nowhere near the sensor
    Serial.println("bright");
    break;
  } 
  delay(1);        // delay in between reads for stability
