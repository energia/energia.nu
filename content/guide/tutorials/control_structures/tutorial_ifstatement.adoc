== If Statement (Conditional Statement) ==

If statements are conditional, which means it allows you to execute certain sections of code +
when certain conditionals are met. If this thing happens, then do that thing.

=== Hardware Required ===

* MSP430 LaunchPad
* (1) Potentiometer or variable resistor
* (1) 220 ohm resistor
* (1) LED
* Hook-up wire
 
=== Relevant Groundwork ===

The http://energia.nu/reference/if/[`*if()*`] statement is the most basic of all programming control structures. It allows you +
to make something happen or not depending on whether a given condition is true or not. It looks like this:

----
if (someCondition) {
   // do stuff if the condition is true
}
----

There is a common variation called if-else that looks like this:

----
if (someCondition) {
   // do stuff if the condition is true
} else {
   // do stuff if the condition is false
}
----

There’s also the else-if, where you can check a second condition if the first is false:

----
if (someCondition) {
   // do stuff if the condition is true
} else if (anotherCondition) {
   // do stuff only if the first condition is false
   // and the second condition is true
}
----

You’ll use if statements all the time. The example below turns on an LED on pin 2 (the built-in +
LED on the MSP-EXP430G2 LaunchPad) if the value read on an analog input goes above a certain threshold.

=== Code Explanation ===

In the code below, a variable called `analogValue` is used to store the data collected from a +
potentiometer connected to the LaunchPad on `analogPin A3`. This data is then compared to a +
threshold value. If the analog value is found to be above the set threshold the LED connected to +
digital pin 2 is turned on. If `analogValue` is found to be `<` threshold, the LED remains off.

/*
  Conditionals - If statement

  This example demonstrates the use of if() statements.
  It reads the state of a potentiometer (an analog input) and turns on an LED
  only if the LED goes above a certain threshold level. It prints the analog value
  regardless of the level.

  The circuit:
  * potentiometer connected to analog pin A3.
    Center pin of the potentiometer goes to the analog pin.
    side pins of the potentiometer go to +3V and ground
  * LED connected from digital pin 2 to ground

  * Note: On the MSP-EXP430G2 LaunchPad boards, there is already an LED connected 
    to pin 2, so you don't need any extra components for this example.

// These constants won't change:
const int analogPin = A3;    // pin that the sensor is attached to
const int ledPin = 2;       // pin that the LED is attached to
const int threshold = 400;   // an arbitrary threshold level that's in the range of the analog input

void setup() {
  // initialize the LED pin as an output:
  pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);
  // initialize serial communications:
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
  // read the value of the potentiometer:
  int analogValue = analogRead(analogPin);

  // if the analog value is high enough, turn on the LED:
  if (analogValue > threshold) {
    digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH);
  } 
  else {
    digitalWrite(ledPin,LOW); 
  }

  // print the analog value:
  Serial.println(analogValue);
  delay(1);        // delay in between reads for stability

=== Try it out ===

– Use an if statement with two conditionals using && or ||.
– Try nesting if statements.
