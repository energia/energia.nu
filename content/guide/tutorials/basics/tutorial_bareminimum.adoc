== Bare Minimum code needed to get started ==

This example contains the bare minimum of code you need for an Energia sketch to compile: the +
`setup()` method and the `loop()` method.

=== Hardware Required ===

* LaunchPad Board

=== Relevant groundwork ===

None

=== Circuit ===

Only your LaunchPad Board is needed for this example.

=== Code Explanation ===

The `setup()` function is called when a sketch starts. Use it to initialize variables, pin modes, start +
using libraries, etc. The setup function will only run once, after each powerup or reset of the +
LaunchPad board.

After creating a `setup()` function, the `loop()` function does precisely what its name suggests, and +
loops consecutively, allowing your program to change and respond as it runs. Code in the `loop()` +
section of your sketch is used to actively control the LaunchPad board. The code below won’t +
actually do anything, but it’s structure is useful for copying and pasting to get you started on any +
sketch of your own. It also shows you how to make comments in your code.

Any line that starts with two slashes (`//`) will not be read by the compiler, so you can write +
anything you want after it. Commenting your code like this can be particularly helpful in +
explaining, both to yourself and others, how your program functions step by step.

=== Code ===

----
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
}
