== Bare Minimum code needed to get started ==

This example contains the bare minimum of code you need for an Energia sketch to compile: the `setup()` method and the `loop()` method.

=== Hardware Required ===

* LaunchPad Board

=== Relevant groundwork ===

None

=== Circuit ===

Only your LaunchPad Board is needed for this example.

=== Code Explanation ===

The `setup()` function is called when a sketch starts. Use it to initialize variables, pin modes, start using libraries, etc. The setup function will only run once, after each powerup or reset of the LaunchPad board.

After creating a `setup()` function, the `loop()` function does precisely what its name suggests, and loops consecutively, allowing your program to change and respond as it runs. Code in the `loop()` section of your sketch is used to actively control the LaunchPad board. The code below won't actually do anything, but it's structure is useful for copying and pasting to get you started on any sketch of your own. It also shows you how to make comments in your code.

Any line that starts with two slashes (`//`) will not be read by the compiler, so you can write anything you want after it. Commenting your code like this can be particularly helpful in explaining, both to yourself and others, how your program functions step by step.

=== Code ===

----
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
}
