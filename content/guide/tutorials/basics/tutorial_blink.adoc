== Blink ==

This example shows how to program MSP430 to blink its LED using Energia.

=== Hardware Required ===

* MSP-EXP430G2 LaunchPad
* LED [ available already as a part of the Launchpad]

=== Relevant groundwork ===

MSP430 has two led pins already attached on the Launchpad. MSP430 has two I/O ports; P0 & P1, with eight I/O lines each. The two leds are connected to port 1. The red led is connected pin 2/ P1.0 and the green led is connected to pin 14/p1.6. The eight lines of two ports can be individually programmed with the help of dedicated port control registers.

[.underline]#*P1DIR*#:

This control register is used in configuring the respective lines of the port as input or output.

A bit field set to 1: configures the respective line as output.

Set to 0: configures the respective line as input.

Ex: The below bit field configuration of P1DIR shows that Line 0 of port 1 is set as output.

----
7	6	5	4	3	2	1	0
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1
----

[.underline]#*P1OUT*#:

This control register is used to write values 0/1 in the respective bit lines configured as output.

Ex: The below bit field configuration of P1OUT shows that Line 0 of port 1 is set to 1.

----
7	6	5	4	3	2	1	0
0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1

=== Circuit ===

MSP430G2 LaunchPad has LED attached to pin 0 and pin 14 on the board itself as shown above in the image. If you run the below code example with no hardware attached, you should see that LED blink.

=== Code Explanation ===

In the program, the first thing you do is to initialize pin 2 [`RED_LED`] as an output pin with the line:

----
pinMode(RED_LED, OUTPUT);
----

In the main loop, you turn the LED on with the line:

----
digitalWrite(RED_LED, HIGH);
----

This supplies 3 volts to pin 2. That creates a voltage difference across the pins of the LED, and lights it up. Then you turn it off with the line:

----
digitalWrite(RED_LINE, LOW);
----

That takes pin 2 back to 0 volts, and turns the LED off. In between the on and the off, you want enough time for a person to see the change, so the `delay()` commands tell the MSP430 to do nothing for 1000 milliseconds, or one second. When you use the `delay()` command, nothing else happens for that amount of time.

=== Code ===
```cpp
/*
  Blink
  The basic Energia example.
  Turns on an LED on for one second, then off for one second, repeatedly.
  Pin 2 has an LED connected on MSP430 boards, has a name 'RED_LED' in the code.
*/

// the setup routine runs once when you press reset:
void setup() {
  // initialize the digital pin as an output.
  pinMode(RED_LED, OUTPUT);
}

// the loop routine runs over and over again forever:
void loop() {
  digitalWrite(RED_LED, HIGH);   // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
  delay(1000);               // wait for a second
  digitalWrite(RED_LED, LOW);    // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
  delay(1000);               // wait for a second
}
```
