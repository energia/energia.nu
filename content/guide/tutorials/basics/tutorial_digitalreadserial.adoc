== Digital Read Serial ==

This example shows you how to monitor the state of a switch by establishing http://energia.nu/reference/serial/[serial +
communication] between your LaunchPad and your computer over USB.

=== Hardware Required ===

* MSP-EXP430G2 LaunchPad
* A momentary switch, button, or toggle switch
* 10k ohm resistor
* Breadboard
* Hook-up wire

=== Relevant Groundwork ===

Any input pin can be used to connect to an external pushbutton. To see what pins support +
external pushbuttons, refer to the hardware http://energia.nu/guide/pinmapping/[pin mapping guide].

You can use the pushbutton on the LaunchPad to complete this exercise.

Connect three wires to the LaunchPad board. The first two, red and black, connect to the two +
long vertical rows on the side of the breadboard to provide access to the 3 volt supply and +
ground. The third wire goes from digital pin 5 (P1.3) to one leg of the pushbutton. That same leg +
of the button connects through a pull-up resistor (here 10 KOhms) to VCC (~3V). The other leg +
of the button connects to ground.

Pushbuttons or switches connect two points in a circuit when you press them. When the +
pushbutton is open (unpressed) there is no connection between the two legs of the pushbutton, +
so the pin is connected to VCC (through the pull-up resistor) and reads as `HIGH`, or 1. When the +
button is closed (pressed), it makes a connection between its two legs, connecting the pin to +
ground, so that the pin reads as `LOW`, or 0.

If you disconnect the digital i/o pin from everything, the LED may blink erratically. This is +
because the input is “floating” – that is, it doesn’t have a solid connection to voltage or ground, +
and it will randomly return either `HIGH` or `LOW`. That’s why you need a pull-up resistor in the +
circuit.

=== Code Explanation ===

In the program below, the very first thing that you do will in the setup function is to begin serial +
communications, at 9600 bits of data per second, between your LaunchPad and your computer +
with the line:

----
Serial.begin(9600);
----

Next, initialize digital pin 5, the pin that will read the output from your button, as an input:

----
pinMode(5,INPUT_PULLUP); //For on-board we need to enable internal pullup resistor
pinMode(5,INPUT); //For external pushbutton we need to use an external pullup resistor
----

Now that your setup has been completed, move into the main loop of your code. When your +
button is pressed, current will freely flow through your circuit, and when it is not pressed, the +
input pin will be connected to ground through the 10-kilohm resistor. This is a digital input, +
meaning that the switch can only be in either an on state (seen by your LaunchPad as a `“1”`, or +
`HIGH`) or an off state (seen by your LaunchPad as a `“0”`, or `LOW`), with nothing in between.

The first thing you need to do in the main loop of your program is to establish a variable to hold +
the information coming in from your switch. Since the information coming in from the switch +
will be either a `“1”` or a `“0”`, you can use an int datatype. Call this variable sensorValue, and set it +
to equal whatever is being read on digital pin 5. You can accomplish all this with just one line of +
code.

----
int sensorValue = digitalRead(5);
----

Once the LaunchPad has read the input, make it print this information back to the computer as +
a decimal value. You can do this with the command `Serial.println()` in our last line of code:

----
Serial.println(sensorValue);
----

Now, when you open your Serial Monitor in the Energia environment, you will see a stream of +
`“1”s` if your switch is open, or `“0”s` if your switch is closed.

*Code Example 1: With on-board pushbutton*

----
/*
  DigitalReadSerial with on-board Pushbutton
  Reads a digital input on pin 5, prints the result to the serial monitor

  This example code is in the public domain.
*/

// digital pin 5 has a pushbutton attached to it. Give it a name:
int pushButton = 5;

// the setup routine runs once when you press reset:
void setup() {
  // initialize serial communication at 9600 bits per second:
  Serial.begin(9600);
  // make the on-board pushbutton's pin an input pullup:
  pinMode(pushButton, INPUT_PULLUP);
}

// the loop routine runs over and over again forever:
void loop() {
  // read the input pin:
  int buttonState = digitalRead(pushButton);
  // print out the state of the button:
  Serial.println(buttonState);
  delay(1);        // delay in between reads for stability
}
