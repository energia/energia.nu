== Button ==

This program shows how to blink an LED on the LaunchPad by switching the pushbutton.

=== Hardware Required ===

* MSP-EXP430G2 LaunchPad
* Pushbutton [available already on-board as part of the LaunchPad]
* LED [available already on-board as a part of the Launchpad]
* Momentary button or switch
* 10K ohm resistor
* Breadboard
* Hook-up wire
 
=== Relevant Groundwork ===

Pushbuttons or switches connect two points in a circuit when you press them. For on-board +
pushbuttons, the pushbuttons ( Pin 1.3) are connected Vcc through PULL-UP resistors. So, +
when the pushbutton is open (unpressed) there is no connection between the two legs of the +
pushbutton, so the pin is connected to Vcc(through the pull-up resistor) and reads as `HIGH`, or +
`1`. When the button is closed (pressed), it makes a connection between its two legs, connecting +
the pin to ground, so the pin reads as `LOW`, or `0`.

External pushbuttons can be connected either through PULL-UP or PULL-DOWN resistors to +
any Digital I/0 pins.

No external circuitry is required.

Connect three wires to the Launch pad board. The first two, red and black, connect to the two +
long vertical rows on the side of the breadboard to provide access to the 3 volt supply and +
ground. The third wire goes from digital pin p1.3 to one leg of the pushbutton. That same leg of +
the button connects through a pull-up resistor (here 10 K Ohms) to Vcc. The other leg of the +
button connects to the ground.

=== Code Explanation ===

In the program, pin 14, which has green LED connected to it, is set up as output in the setup +
function.

----
pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);
----

Here the ledpin refers to the `GREEN_LED` which is set as output. The push button which is +
connected to pin 5 is set up as input. The pull-up resistor connected to this pin is enabled.

----
pinMode(buttonPin, INPUT_PULLUP);
----

In the main loop, the state of the push button is read to check if it is pressed or not. The state of +
the pushbutton is read into variable buttonState.

----
buttonState = digitalRead(buttonPin);
----

If the `buttonState` is `HIGH`, it means that push button was pressed else it is not. Whenever the +
button state is `HIGH`, the Green LED is accordingly switched `ON` else it is switched `OFF`.

/* Turns on and off a light emitting diode(LED) connected to digital pin 14, 
   when pressing a pushbutton attached to pin 2. 
  The circuit:
  * LED attached from pin 14 to ground 
  * pushbutton attached to pin 5 from ~3V
  * 10K resistor attached to pin 5 from ground
