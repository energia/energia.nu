== Input Pull-up Serial ==

This program shows the use of INPUT_PULLUP with `pinMode( )`. It monitors the state of a +
switch by establishing serial communication between your Launchpad.

=== Hardware Required ===

* MSP-EXP430G2 LaunchPad
* Pushbutton [available already on-board as part of the LaunchPad]
* LED [available already on-board as a part of the Launchpad]
* Momentary button or switch
* 10K ohm resistor
* Breadboard
* Hook-up wire

=== Relevant Groundwork ===

By Enabling the Pull up resistor connected to an input pin. The output goes `HIGH` when the +
input is `LOW` and the output goes `LOW` when the input is `HIGH`.

Connect three wires to the Launch pad board. The first two, red and black, connect to the two +
long vertical rows on the side of the breadboard to provide access to the 3 volt supply +
and ground. The third wire goes from digital pin p1.3 to one leg of the pushbutton. That same leg of +
the button connects through a pull-up resistor (here 10 K Ohms) to Vcc. The other leg of the +
button connects to the ground.

=== Code Explanation ===

In the program, pin 14, which has green LED connected to it, is set up as output in the setup +
function.

----
pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);
----

Here the `ledpin` refers to the GREEN_LED which is set as output. The push button which is +
connected to pin 5 is set up as input. The pull-up resistor connected to this pin is enabled.

----
pinMode(buttonPin, INPUT_PULLUP);
----

Begin serial communications, at 9600 bits of data per second, between your Launchpad and +
your computer with the line.

----
Serial.begin(9600);
----

In the main loop, the value of the push button is continuously read and printed on serial +
terminal. If the value of pin 5 to which pushbutton is attached, is `HIGH`, then a `LOW` is written + 
to pin 14 to which green LED is attached. Likewise if pin 5 is `LOW`, then pin 14 is made `HIGH`.

----
if (buttonPushCounter % 4 == 0) {
    digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH);
} else {
   digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW);
}

/*
  Input Pullup Serial

  This example demonstrates the use of pinMode(INPUT_PULLUP). It reads a 
  digital input on pin 5 and prints the results to the serial monitor.

  Unlike pinMode(INPUT), there is no pull-down resistor necessary. An internal 
  resistor is pulled to 3.3V. This configuration causes the input to 
  read HIGH when the switch is open, and LOW when it is closed.
