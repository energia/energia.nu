== Debounce ==

This program shows how to blink a led by switching the pushbutton and check for debounce.

=== Hardware Required ===

* MSP-EXP430G2 LaunchPad
* Pushbutton [available already on-board as part of the LaunchPad]
* LED [available already on-board as a part of the Launchpad]
* Momentary button or switch
* 10K ohm resistor
* Breadboard
* Hook-up wire

=== Relevant Groundwork ===

This example demonstrates the use of a pushbutton as a switch: each time you press the button, the LED (or whatever) is turned on (if it's off) or off (if on). It also *debounces* the input, which means checking twice in a short period of time to make sure it's definitely pressed. Without debouncing, pressing the button once can appear to the code as multiple presses. `millis()` function is used to keep track of the time when the button is pressed.

Connect three wires to the Launch pad board. The first two, red and black, connect to the two long vertical rows on the side of the breadboard to provide access to the 3 volt supply and ground. The third wire goes from digital pin p1.3 to one leg of the pushbutton. That same leg of the button connects through a pull-up resistor (here 10 K Ohms) to Vcc. The other leg of the button connects to the ground.

=== Code Explanation ===

In the program, pin 14, which has green LED connected to it, is set up as output in the setup function.

----
pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);
----

Here the ledpin refers to the `GREEN_LED` which is set as output. The push button which is connected to pin 5 is set up as input. The pull-up resistor connected to this pin is enabled.

----
pinMode(buttonPin, INPUT_PULLUP);
----

In the main loop, the state of the pushbutton is saved in the variable ''reading''.

----
int reading = digitalRead(buttonPin);
----

If the state of the pushbutton has changed from its previous stored state, then the time at which it was pressed is obtained with the help of `millis( )` and saved.

----
if (reading != lastButtonState) {
    lastDebounceTime = millis();
}
----

If the `buttonState` didn't change for a time equal to debounce delay, then it means that it is the actual current stable state of the push button and this is reflected accordingly in the output pin connected to LED as well.

----
if ((millis( ) - lastDebounceTime) > debounceDelay) {
    buttonState = reading;
} 
digitalWrite(ledPin, buttonState);

  // (i.e. the input went from LOW to HIGH),  and you've waited 
  // long enough since the last press to ignore any noise:
