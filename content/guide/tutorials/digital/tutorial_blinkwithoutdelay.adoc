== Blink without delay ==

This example shows how to program MSP430 LaunchPad to blink its LED without using delay function using Energia.

=== Hardware Required ===

* MSP-EXP430G2 LaunchPad
* LED [available already on-board as a part of the Launchpad]

=== Relevant Groundwork ===

Using `delay( )` while trying to blink the LED helps in discerning the blinking of LED, which otherwise would be difficult in noticing. The disadvantage of using delay function is, it brings all activities to halt. Sometimes when you need to do two things at once, For example, you might want to blink an LED (or some other time-sensitive function) while reading a button press or other input. In this case, you can't use `delay()`, or you'd stop everything else the program while the LED blinked. The program might miss the button press if it happens during the `delay( )`.

This code below demonstrates how to blink the LED without using `delay()`. It keeps track of the last time the Launchpad turned the LED on or off. Then, each time through `loop()`, it checks if a long enough interval has passed. If it has, it toggles the LED on or off.

MSP430 LaunchPad has LED attached to pin 2 and pin 14 on the board itself as shown above in the image. If you run the below code example with no hardware attached, you should see that LED blink.

=== Code Explanation ===

In the program, pin 14 is set up as output in the setup function.

----
pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);
----

Here the ledpin refers to the `GREEN_LED` which is set as output.

In the main loop, in order to measure delay without using the delay function, current time, which is the time elapsed in milliseconds since the Launchpad was booted up is obtained using `millis( )`. The difference of this current time with the previous time ( which is 0 initially) when LED blinked is checked. If the difference exceeds the delay time interval,

----
if(currentMillis - previousMillis > interval)
----

Then, the last time when LED blinked is saved,

----
previousMillis = currentMillis;
----

The state of the LED is now switched. If LED is ON, then it is turned off and vice-versa.

----
if (ledState == LOW)
      ledState = HIGH;
else
      ledState = LOW;
----

The state of the output pin connected to LED reflects this accordingly,

----
digitalWrite(ledPin, ledState);
----

=== Code ===

/* Blink without Delay

  Turns on and off a light emitting diode(LED) connected to a digital  
  pin, without using the delay() function.  This means that other code
  can run at the same time without being interrupted by the LED code.

  In MSP430 Launchpad, there is already an LED on the board that's 
  attached to pin 14, so no hardware is needed for this example.
