The Energia https://forum.43oh.com/forum/119-energia/[discussion forum] is hosted on https://43oh.com/[43oh.com] courtesy of bluehash. The http://energia.nu/pin-maps/[Hardware pin map guides] are a good place to learn about what the different pins on the LaunchPads can be used for. The http://energia.nu/reference/[reference] manual lists out the common APIs and how they function. You can also use the http://energia.nu/guide/[guide] for many code examples and tutorials. The https://www.youtube.com/user/EnergiaForLaunchPad[Energia Youtube] channel contains many video tutorials.  Use the search bar to find specific content. Live help from community members is also available through the #energia and #43oh IRC channel on freenode IRC, which you can access directly from the energia.nu site under the http://energia.nu/irc/[IRC] tab.  Lastly, if you have a technical question relating to the hardware, you can also ask for help on TIâ€™s http://e2e.ti.com/[E2E forum].
