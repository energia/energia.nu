== readBytesUntil() ==
== Description ==
Serial.readBytesUntil() reads characters from the serial buffer into an array. The function terminates if the terminator character is detected, the determined length has been read, or it times out (see link:../serial_settimeout[Serial.setTimeout()]). Serial.readBytesUntil() returns the number of characters read into the buffer. A 0 means no valid data was found. Serial.readBytesUntil() inherits from the link:../../stream[Stream] utility class.
