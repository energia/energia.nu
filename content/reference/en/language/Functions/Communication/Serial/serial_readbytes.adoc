== readBytes() ==
=== Description ===
Serial.readBytes() reads characters from the serial port into a buffer. The function terminates if the determined length has been read, or it times out (see link:../serial_settimeout[Serial.setTimeout()]). Serial.readBytes() returns the number of characters placed in the buffer. A 0 means no valid data was found. Serial.readBytes() inherits from the link:../../stream[Stream] utility class.

Serial.readBytes(buffer, length)

 

=== Parameters ===
buffer: the buffer to store the bytes in (char[] or byte[])
