== readBytes() ==
=== Description ===
Serial.readBytes() reads characters from the serial port into a buffer. The function terminates if the determined length has been read, or it times out (see link:../serial_settimeout[Serial.setTimeout()]). Serial.readBytes() returns the number of characters placed in the buffer. A 0 means no valid data was found. Serial.readBytes() inherits from the link:/reference/en/language/functions/communication/stream/[Stream] utility class.
