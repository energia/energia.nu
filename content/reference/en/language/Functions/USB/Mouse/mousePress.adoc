= Mouse.press()


// OVERVIEW SECTION STARTS

[float]
=== Description
Sends a button press to a connected computer. A press is the equivalent of clicking and continuously holding the mouse button. A press is cancelled with link:../mouserelease[Mouse.release()].

Before using `Mouse.press()`, you need to start communication with link:../mousebegin[Mouse.begin()].

`Mouse.press()` defaults to a left button press.

  if(digitalRead(2) == HIGH){

=== Notes and Warnings
When you use the `Mouse.press()` command, the Arduino takes over your mouse! Make sure you have control before you use the command. A pushbutton to toggle the mouse control state is effective.
